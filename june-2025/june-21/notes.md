Problem 2: Valid Anagram

Problem 3: Two Sum

Problem 4: Group Anagrams

## Problem 2: Valid Anagram - Revisited

### Notes

It was pretty easy to remember the approach for checking valid anagram instances.

## Problem 3: Two Sum - Revisited

### Notes

I remembered how to solve the problem, but had an error at some point when I wasn't adding `nums[i]`
to `found` if `diff` wasn't found in the map.

## Problem 4: Group Anagrams - Revisited

### Notes

It was actually really easy to remember the steps for completing this problem, but I should attempt solving
this problem with a regular dictionary instead of a `defaultdict`.
